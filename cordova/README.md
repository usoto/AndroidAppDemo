# [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org)

+ an open-source mobile development framework
+ allows to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language
+ Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status
+ extend an application across more than one platform, without having to re-implement it with each platform's language and tool set
+ to deploy a web app that's packaged for distribution in various app store portals
+ allows mixing native application components with a WebView (special browser window) that can access device-level APIs, or a plugin interface between native and WebView components
